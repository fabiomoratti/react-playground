# React Playground

A repo to learn and play with react while following [Full React Course 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UZrsTqkcW4)
at [Free Code Camp](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ).

The initial version of the repo is practically a clone of [react-advanced-2020](https://github.com/john-smilga/react-advanced-2020).


Note: the files: 
 - src/index-basic.js
 - src/index-basic.css
 - src/Book.js
 - src/books.js
Are from the initial part of the course and deal with basic stuff.
